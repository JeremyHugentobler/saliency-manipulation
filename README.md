# Saliency Driven Image Manipulatoin - CS413 Project

Our task was to reconstruct the method introduced by [Mechrez & al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02184) allowing to increase the saliency of an object in a picture.

Code and data of the paper are missing from their repository, so we had to replace some componenents:
- Saliency map model: [Tempsal](https://github.com/IVRL/Tempsal) from IVRL, using the weights available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160WB1YrPAjNYy787jP1pmffl9Xv0gLw6) (needed in *./Tempsal/src/checkpoints/* to execute the code)

## Python environnement
Conda was used to set-up the needed librairies and the environment can be added by using the *environment.yml* file

# Algorithm overview
TODO: Write
